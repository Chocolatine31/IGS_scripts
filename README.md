 IGS scripts

"Data wrangling" prepares layers for the suitability mapping process, and other data preparation.

"Suitability Mapping" is the main script for creating suitability maps, based on parameters in excel tables.

"Results Analysis" calculates energy output, and various land impact statistics.

"Parameters.xlsx" contains the parameters for the Suitability Mapping and Results Analysis scripts.

"PAs_labels", "Peatland_labels", "UK_ALC_labels" and "UKCEH_LC_2023_10m_labels" contain the category labels for the land stats in Results Analysis (otherwise the script will return numerical categories)

"sds2024_IGS.yml" environment file listing all the necessary packages

Pre-processed suitability layers have not been shared because they have not been reviewed for potential licensing restrictions. If access is required please contact the author.
